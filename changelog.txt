# 0.1.3
* Generate descriptions for attrs in elements
* Add attrs documentation

# 0.1.2
* [bugfix] Pass children arg in elements
* Sort attr list so generated element code doesn't change arbitrarily

# 0.1.1
* Add element import to module import i.e. from html_compose import div

* Remove callable on attr template which is already non functionable

* [breaking] Move BaseElement children kwarg position ahead of anyone using it

* Code generator no longer translates attr list for html element because the living HTML doc changed. I caught this with an assertion!

* Remove data attr, you can define that on your own or subclass

* Generate elements with attr list in params. I'm intentionally not choosing kwargs to favor explicit over implicit support. For everything else, theres attrs=

* Remove callable references for attr system. I was going to make attrs evaluate callables but i decided the element resolution system is enough and the complexity has burden to also maintain in attrs.

* Add exception when you fail to initialize an element: `div["test"]` raises an error because you forgot `div()`
